# Snake-Confetti.io-Game
Remake of the notable Snake Game

The main objective of the game is for the user to control the snake using their 
computer keys to guide the snake to the apples that appear. Each apple that they 
manage the snake to ‘eat’, the user gets one point. However, if the snake touches a 
part of their body, like the head  or tail, or bumps into the top/left/right/border 
of the screen, the user loses the game.

It’ll be ideal to run the game using the SnakePanel Class, but I don’t think that will be necessary. 
A couple things to note is that you might want to run the game 2 or more times because 
the background color of the panel changes color every time you enter the game. Also, 
turn up your volume when you run the program because I added sound to the program. You can 
also use your arrow keys or the W A S B keys on your keyboard to play the game.
